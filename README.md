THIS IS NOT TO BE USED BY ANYONE, BUT THE DEVELOPERS FOR NOW!!!!!
This is due to it having some heavy bugs, that need to be fixed.
I made this when I was 12, uploaded when I was 13, cut me some slack.

Some General Things:<br>
Thank you for installing this script. If you have any problems please report them with through the issues tab.<br>
If you require any extra support, please contact me via the email exusneo@gmail.com<br>
<br>
Instructions:<br>
1) Make a MySQL database, and make a User, then input the information into the configuration.php file<br>
2) Goto wherever you installed the script in your browser, then goto the setup folder<br> (http://yourdomain.com/whereveruinstalledthis/setup/)<br>
3) The setup file should run and redirect you to a page. Register with your own information, then delete the setup folder. (when you register through the setup folder, you instantly gain Administrator Privileges).<br>
4) Go back to wherever you installed the script, then login. Once you've logged in go to wherever you've installed the script and goto the acp folder (http://yourdomain.com/whereveryouinstalledthis/acp/). ACP = Administrator Control Panel -[b]YOU MUST BE LOGGED IN[/b]<br>
5) Now the scripts pretty much installed, goto the configuration.php file and you can edit the homepage things from there. Anything else you will have to edit the separate pages for.<br>
6) For anyone who wants to get payments you NEED a business PayPal Account. You need to goto MyAccount -> Then Click Profile -> Then Click "Instant Payment Notification Preferences", then click Turn On IPN -> Then click "Edit Settings" -> then set the "Notification URL" to mydomain.com/whereIinstalledthescriptto/ipn/ipn.php tell your developers to do that as well.

These were made a while back, I don’t know if they’re still correct or not.
This is a slightly updated version of what I released back a while ago, with a different control panel UI.
Everything is going for another redesign
