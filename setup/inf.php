Your account has been setup and you have been given administrator privlages, to access the administrator control panel you type:<br>
http://yourdomain.com/acp/<br>
the yourdomain.com thing you have to change.<br>
If that doesnt work then you have probably put it into a folder so you do:<br>
http://yourdomain.com/whateveryounamedthefolder/acp<br>


<h1><b>YOU MUST DELETE THE SETUP FOLDER</b></h1>
